This folder includes more elegant version of the DL code for gait segmentation (not identifcation).
The 'gait segmentaion' code includes the functions that are needed for running the pipeline.
The main file use to run the pieline and has 2 configurations:
1. Process: read the acceleration mat files and process the data to fit the NN (UNet). 
Input: acceleration samples and corresponded labels in mat format.
Output: train and test dataloaders for training the model with pytorch.

2. Models: train the model.
Input: The output of the 'process' step.
Output: saved model, loss, train and validation accuracy (save the results for each epoch)
